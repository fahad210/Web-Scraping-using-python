# Web Scraping Using Python

## What is Data Extraction?
Data extraction is a process that involves retrieval of data from different website sources. Firms extract data in order to analyze it, migrate the data to a data repository (data warehouse) or use it in their businesses.

It consists of scraping valuable business information and compiling it in a spreadsheet/CSV for future use. Data scrapping tools help you to automatically scrape quality data while reducing your acquisition costs so you can make good decisions.
